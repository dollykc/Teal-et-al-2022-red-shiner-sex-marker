# Teal-et-al-2022-red-shiner-sex-marker
scripts developed and modified for the manuscript Teal et al 2022, "The development of genetic sex identification markers and evidence of a male heterogametic sex determination system in Red Shiner Cyprinella lutrensis"

MaxGenoXY.py relies upon outfiles from https://github.com/delomast/stacks_to_sex_marker/blob/master/vcf_sex_markers.py 
vcf_sex_markers looks through Stacks outputs for sex linked patterns in loci. From those results, MaxGenoXY.py lists the loci that have the highest number of samples (above 50th and 75th quartile) genotyped
